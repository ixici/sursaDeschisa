#Why have a open source repository?

##Many reasons:

1. Commit your work into the history, or as a backup: [GitHub will store all of its public open source code in an Arctic vault](https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/15/github-store-public-open-source-code-arctic-vault/)
2. Use your code for reference in your resume or CV - or just as a portofolio
3. Use the commits as a true timestamp for your work.
